We the Citizens of the Free Republic of Liberland, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for Liberland as its supreme law, deriving its just authority from the law of nature and the consent of the governed.

Part One

1. Provisions Subject to Amendment

  1.1 The Government of Liberland 

    1.1.1 The Government of Liberland shall consist of the General Court and a number of Sovereign Cantons. 

    1.1.2 The Citizens of Liberland shall be any persons who, being competent, shall have signed and assented to this Constitution. 

    Citizenship carries with it the right to vote and eligibility for public office, which are denied to non-Citizens; it carries with it also the liability to taxation by the General Court and by the Citizen's Canton, from which liability non-Citizens are exempt. Thus the Government of Liberland is a voluntary cooperative association, with free exit and entry, and taxation is thus likewise voluntary, being conditional on Citizenship. Citizens may renounce their Citizenship at any time, and reclaim it later as they choose.
    No competent person shall be barred from Citizenship. Criminal conviction shall not remove the rights, nor public office the responsibilities, of Citizenship.

    1.1.3 Every Citizen shall have the right to launch a popular initiative calling for a national referendum to recall the President of Liberland or any member of the Council, or to repeal any Act of the General Court, exclusive of the provisions of this Constitution, by majority vote; a petition by not fewer than n1 citizens shall be sufficient to establish the referendum. A referendum vote must be held within 90 days of the attainment of the appropriate number of petitioners. If a Councilor is recalled, a special election may be held to fill the vacant seat with the winner of the election serving the remainder of the recalled Councilor s term. 

    1.1.4 Persons who acquire Citizenship after the first year following the ratification of this Constitution shall be required to maintain their Citizenship in good standing for minimum of two consecutive years to be eligible to hold public office, vote in elections, or to launch a popular initiative. 

    1.1.5 The General Court shall consist of an Assembly, Council, Executive, and Judiciary. 

  1.2 The Assembly 

    1.2.1. The Assembly shall be composed of Citizens representing the Cantons. Each Canton, regardless of size, shall send exactly one representative to the Assembly. These representatives are to be chosen in accordance with the laws of the respective Cantons. Each representative shall serve a seven-year term; no
    representative may serve more than one term consecutively or three terms non-consecutively. Representatives may be recalled in accordance with the laws of the relevant Canton.

    1.2.2 The Assembly shall be vested with the authority to provide for the common defense and to manage the foreign affairs of the nation.

    It shall have no legislative authority, no power to make or enforce laws, regulations, or ordnances as all legislative, regulatory, and enforcement powers authorized by this Constitution lie with the Cantons.

    It shall have the power to propose, by two-thirds vote, policies, rules, or resolutions directing the actions of the Executive as it provides for the common defense and manages the foreign affairs provided that no Act compel or coerce Citizens or non-Citizens in any way.

    Any Act, in order to advance to the Council for approval, must embrace no more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title; appropriations shall concern only spending of monies and shall not mandate any other action or conduct, nor shall any Act contain more than one item of appropriation, and that for one expressed purpose.

    1.2.3 The powers of the Assembly shall be restricted to the following:

      a) to direct the Executive as it provides for the common defense and     protection of Citizens of Liberland from foreign aggression; 
    ï‚· 
      b) to make and approve of a budget; 
    
      c) to approve of the laying and collecting of taxes on the Citizens of Liberland, for the purpose of paying the debts and providing for the common defense provided that all taxes are levied at a flat and uniform rate across the Citizenry; the Assembly may solicit voluntary contributions to the Treasury, or approve of services such as lotteries to that end and which funds may be earmarked for tax reduction among low income Citizens. 

      d) to declare war in defense of the people of Liberland, and to make peace, and to authorize and support a military force; 

      e) to provide for calling forth a militia to suppress insurrections, and repel invasions; 

      f) to vest the appointment of such officers whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, in the Executive or in the Judiciary, as deemed proper; 

      g) to impeach any officer who has lost the confidence of the Assembly, violated this Constitution, or committed a high crime or misdemeanor upon a majority vote and with the consent of a majority of the Council; 

      h) to pass judgment on the incorporation, under this Constitution, of new territory provided the people of territory consent to the incorporation; 

      i) to propose Amendments to this Constitution as detailed in Section 2.1; 

      j) to make such arrangements as shall be necessary for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government, or in any department or officer thereof, provided that no arrangement imposing restrictions on the people shall be regarded as necessary.

    1.2.4 No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by approval of The Assembly pursuant to this Constitution; and statements and accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the Government shall regularly be made public; neither shall money shall be appropriated to any Canton through grants, subsidies, bailouts, conditional payment or any other means. All Cantons shall be expected to raise their own revenue. 

    1.2.5 Having no legislative authority, the Assembly shall be prohibited from creating and/or funding law enforcement agencies of any kind. If a Citizen fails to meet his or her tax liability, the Executive may sue for breach of contract in a court of law in the same manner as would any person or institution. 

    1.2.6 The Assembly shall determine its own rules of procedure, and choose its own officers, including the Speaker of the Assembly.

  1.3 The Council 

    1.3.1 The Council shall be composed of Citizens representing the Citizens of Liberland. There shall be a minimum of n13 Councilors. Half of these Councilors, the Councilors by Election, are to be chosen by instant run-off vote of the Citizens from electoral districts of equal population. The other half, the Councilors by Lot, are to be selected randomly from 
    pools, in each electoral district, of all Citizens willing to serve. These two kinds of Councilors shall have identical voting rights. Each Councilor shall serve a seven-year term; no Councilor may serve more than one term consecutively or three terms non-consecutively. Councilors of either sort may be recalled by referendum as detailed in 1.1.4.

    In the case of elections, a petition of not fewer than n11 Citizens shall be sufficient to place a candidate on the ballot; and each ballot shall contain the alternative "None of the above is acceptable." In the event that "None of the above is acceptable" receives a plurality of votes in any election, the elective office for that term shall remain unfilled and unfunded.

    Upon ratification of this Constitution and subsequent to the first election, Councilors shall be assigned terms by lot, with one retiring at the end of the first year, another at the end of the second, and another at the end of the third and so on through the seventh year so as to provide for one-seventh of the Council up for election each year.

    The Assembly may, at its discretion, increase the number of Councilors, provided the total not exceed one tenth the number of representatives in Assembly.

    1.3.2 All Acts of Assembly, prior to enactment, must receive the consent of two-thirds of the Council. 

    1.3.3 The Council shall have no power to propose policies, rules, resolutions, or amendments; but shall have, in addition to the power of vetoing Acts of the Assembly, the power to repeal any already existing Act by a one-third-plus-one vote. The Council shall also have power to pass judgment on proposed Amendments to this Constitution as detailed in Section 2.1.

    1.3.4 The Council shall regulate its own affairs, determine its own rules of procedure, and choose its own officers, including the High Councilor.

  1.4 The Executive 

    1.4.1 The Assembly shall, upon majority vote, and with the advice and consent of a majority of the Council, appoint the President of Liberland. 

    Each President shall serve a term of no longer than five years; no President may serve more than one such term consecutively or three such terms non-consecutively.

    The President may be removed from office by a majority vote of the Assembly and Council 0r by national referendum as detailed in 1.1.4.

    1.4.2 The President shall, once per year, prepare the Annual Report of the Government of Liberland for the Assembly, Council, Cantons, and the People of Liberland. The report shall contain a comprehensive account of the activities of the Government during the prior year, information on the state of the nation, detailed financial statements including the balance sheet, income and cash flow statements, and recommendations for such measures as the President shall judge necessary and expedient. The report shall be audited by a neutral third party.
    1.4.3 The powers of the President shall be restricted to the following:

    a) to be Commander in Chief of the military, when called into the actual service of Liberland (but this shall not be construed to extend to the President the power to initiate military action) and to maintain a military force necessary to protect the People of Liberland but under no circumstances shall the military be used for domestic law enforcement, police patrol, or domestic surveillance. 

    b) to negotiate treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other public officers, by and with the advice and consent a majority of the Assembly and Council, and to commission all the officers of the Free Republic of Liberland; though no treaty may enlarge the powers delegated to the Government by this Constitution. 

    c) to receive ambassadors and other public ministers; 

    d) to submit a budget to the Assembly for its consideration and to manage the finances of the Government, but no appropriation shall be made except where explicitly authorized by this Constitution. 

    e) to convene, on extraordinary occasions, the Assembly and Council (but the President shall not convene them at strange or difficult times or locations). 

  1.4.4 It shall be the duty of the President, and those in his Administration, to refuse assent to or execution of any Act in conflict with the Constitution of the Liberland, and to grant reprieves and pardons to any persons accused of violating such Acts.

  1.4.5 The Assembly may provide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability of the President, declaring what officer shall succeed to that office, and such officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or a new President shall be selected in the usual manner.

  1.5 The Judiciary 

    1.5.1 The Judiciary shall be composed of a Supreme Court and an independent judiciary. 

    1.5.2 The Supreme Court shall consist of n6 Citizens, and shall judge by majority vote. Appointments to the Supreme Court, barring impeachment, shall be for an indefinite term, or until such age of retirement as may be specified by the Assembly (except that legal changes in the age of retirement shall not affect the term of existing appointments), and shall appointed by a majority of the Assembly with the advice and consent of a majority of the Council. 

    Supreme Court Justices may be removed from office at any time by a majority vote of the Assembly and Council.

    1.5.3 The independent judiciary shall consist in a private judicial service or services, under contract to the Government. Such contracts are to be approved a majority vote of the Assembly and Council and revoked by a majority vote of the same. Such private judicial service shall be considered a division of the Judiciary
    (and thus of the Government under this Constitution) for the duration of its contract and no longer.

    1.5.4 Cases brought before the Judiciary shall be first heard by the independent judiciary; the Supreme Court shall serve as the final court of appeal, but may refuse to hear any appeal. 

    1.5.5 Fees for court services shall be determined by the Assembly with the approval of the Council. 

    1.5.6 The power of the Judiciary shall be restricted in the first instance to the adjudication of disputes, where no prior arbitration agreement exists, 

      between one Canton and another, or 

      between one Canton and members of another, or 

      between members of different Cantons, or 

      between a Canton and its own members, or 

      between a Canton and non-Citizens, or 

      between Citizens and non-Citizens, or 

      among non-Citizens. 

    1.5.7 In addition, 
    
      disputes among members of the same Canton may be adjudicated by the Judiciary if the laws of that Canton grant such jurisdiction to the Judiciary; 

      disputes to which the independent judiciary is a party may be adjudicated by the Supreme Court; 

      disputes to which the Supreme Court is a party may be adjudicated by the independent judiciary, without appeal to the Supreme Court; 

      disputes between the Supreme Court and the independent judiciary, and disputes to which the Judiciary as a whole is a party, may be adjudicated in such manner as the Assembly may determine;

      disputes between the independent judiciary and other divisions of the Government are to be adjudicated as provided by contract; and 

      disputes with Government officials for rights violations stemming from actions of official capacity shall be adjudicated according to normal process as determined by the Cantons of the accuser and the accused. 

    1.5.8 It shall be the duty of all parties to this compact, including the Judiciary, to strike down as void and unlawful any Acts or Appropriations in conflict with this Constitution.

    Failure of the Judiciary to strike down an Act of Government shall not be construed to legitimize the Act nor to affirm its constitutionality or lawfulness nor to prohibit the other parties from passing judgment on its Constitutionality.

    In cases not within this compact, each Canton shall reserve the right to judge for itself and to nullify on its own authority all assumption of powers by others.

    1.5.9 In the course of interpreting this document, where words are susceptible of two meanings, one consistent, and the other inconsistent, with justice and natural right, that meaning, and only that meaning, which is consistent with right, shall be attributed to them -- unless other parts of the instrument overrule that interpretation.
    
    No language except that which is peremptory, and no implication, except one that is inevitable, shall be held to authorize or sanction anything contrary to natural right.
    
    No extraneous or historical evidence shall be admitted to fix upon a statute an unjust or immoral meaning, when the words themselves of the act are susceptible of an innocent one.

    1.5.10 No person shall be convicted, sentenced, or imprisoned without due process of law, including the right to trial by jury and habeas corpus, and there shall be no detention without trial, nor shall any person either before or after trial be held incommunicado. An accused person shall be assumed innocent until proven guilty. A person who has been arrested, detained, imprisoned, tried, or sentenced either illegally or in error shall receive restitution. At every stage of criminal process, an accused shall be informed of the charges against him or her, and to the privilege of counsel. An accused who does not speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted shall be provided without expense the services of an interpreter. 

    1.5.11 The right of the people to be secure in their persons, dwellings, vehicles, papers, communications and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in 
    jeopardy of penalty; nor shall any be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against him or herself, nor be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law. Where illegally obtained evidence is judged to be admissible in court, those who obtained it remain subject to criminal prosecution.

    1.5.12 The Judiciary shall have no power of compulsory witness, nor of compulsory jury empanelment. 

    1.5.13 It shall be the chief aim of judicial adjudication, using principles of common law and equity, to secure restitution for the victim to the fullest degree possible at the expense of the criminal or wrongdoer. Likewise, the prosecution shall as far as possible make full restitution for all loss suffered by persons arrested, indicted, restrained, imprisoned, expropriated, or otherwise injured in the course of criminal proceedings that do not result in their conviction. When they are responsible, government employees or agents shall be liable for this restitution. 

    The claim of a victim (or class of victims) to restitution shall be a marketable claim, which may be acquired through gift or sale (or, in the case of deceased victims, through bequest or homesteading).

    1.5.14 The victim shall have the right to direct the prosecution in criminal cases, so far as is consistent with full respect for the rights of the accused. 

    1.5.15 Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor torture or other cruel, unusual, or degrading treatment inflicted. Convicted criminals shall not have their liberty restricted except so far as is necessary for the attainment of justice or for the protection of others, nor their property seized except so far as is necessary to make restitution to the victim and to pay the costs of the criminal's capture and trial.

    1.5.16 The Judiciary shall not construe any part of this Constitution to be without effect or to be judicially unenforceable; nor shall appeals to international law or the laws of nations nullify any part of this Constitution or enlarge the powers delegated to the Government.

  1.6 The Cantons 

    1.6.1 In becoming a Citizen of the Liberland, one also chooses membership in a Canton. The Cantons are not geographically or territorially defined entities, but free associations of Citizens. Members of one Canton may change their membership at any time to that of another Canton, without change in residence. 

    1.6.2 The political constitution or bylaws of each Canton shall initially be chosen by majority vote of its members; subsequent Canton laws shall be passed, and measures for enforcement determined, in accordance with the provisions of that constitution. The constitution of and laws of each Canton shall be binding on its members, subject to the provision that such constitution and laws may not conflict with the Constitution of Liberland, and that free exit and entry must always be permitted. No Canton shall have authority over persons who are not its members, unless by prior agreement with those persons or with their 
    Canton, except insofar as is necessary to protect against aggression the rights of its members to their persons and property. The method of determining a Canton's vote on proposed Amendments to the Constitution of Liberland (see Section 2.1) shall be determined by the constitution or laws of that Canton.

    1.6.3 No Citizen shall be denied membership in a Canton, except on the grounds that he or she is already a member of another Canton. Plural Canton membership shall be permissible if authorized by the laws of the Cantons involved but in such case the Citizen must choose a primary Canton for representation purposes. 

    1.6.4 Any association of n7 or more Citizens may constitute themselves as a new Canton under the Constitution. On Election Day each year, the Cantons shall report their total membership. Cantons whose membership exceeds .02% of the Citizenry shall be granted representation in Assembly and voting rights for the following one year period. Cantons which, on this date, fail to meet the minimum membership requirement shall be without both during the following year. 

    1.6.5 In order to ensure fair representation, all Cantons must be functionally independent of each other to be eligible to send a representative to the Assembly and to vote for Amendments to the Constitution. If a Canton is, either in fact or in function, a subsidiary of a larger organization of Cantons, the organization will be granted Canton status and voting rights and the subsidiaries will be denied both. 

    1.6.6 A Canton may dissolve itself in accordance with its own laws. 

    1.6.7 Disputes among members of the same Canton, if adjudicated under this Constitution, are to be adjudicated in accordance with the laws of that Canton, allowing or not allowing for appeal to the Judiciary as those laws may determine. Disputes across Canton boundaries are to be adjudicated as detailed in the section on the Judiciary. 

    1.6.8 No Canton shall, without the consent of the Assembly, enter into any agreement or compact with a foreign power, or engage in war unless required by such imminent danger as will not admit of delay. 

Part Two

Provisions Not Subject to Amendment

  2.1 Provision for Amendments 

    2.1.1 The Assembly and Council, whenever four-fifths of both bodies deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, which Amendments shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this Constitution when ratified by both four-fifths of the Cantons (to be determined as the laws of the individual cantons shall direct) and two-thirds of the Citizens, provided that no Amendment shall in any manner affect Part Two of this Constitution. 

    2.1.2 All Amendments shall collectively constitute Part Three of this Constitution; the Executive shall have the 
    power to enforce any Amendment, so far as such power is consistent with those provisions of the Constitution not subject to Amendment.

  2.2 Bill of Rights 

    2.2.1 The following protections of rights shall be binding upon all branches of the Government at all times and upon the Cantons insofar as consent by either members or non-members to these ends has not been attained. 

    Public officials and government employees possess no special rights, immunities, or exemptions not possessed by other Citizens; nor shall crimes against the Government or its officers be labeled "treason," or regarded as more serious than crimes against other organizations or individuals. Moreover, apart from the rights of suffrage, referendum initiative, and the holding of public office under this Constitution, which are reserved to Citizens alone, the following rights apply to all persons equally, regardless of Citizenship or residency, with the qualification that persons judged incompetent (e.g., young children, or the mentally ill) may have their rights suspended in order to secure those ends to which, so far as can be established, they would be likely to consent if competent; but such persons retain in full force, as do others acting on their behalf, the right to challenge in court their status as incompetent no less often than once a year, and to sue for false judgment. Every person
    of the age of n13 or greater shall be assumed competent, and every person under the age of n13 shall be assumed incompetent, until proven otherwise in a court. The standard of evidence necessary to prove incompetence shall be higher than the standard of evidence necessary to prove competence.

    2.2.2 The laws of Liberland shall apply equally to all persons regardless of gender, ethnicity, opinions, religion, national origin, or peaceful lifestyle. 

    2.2.3 No law shall abridge the right of each person to do as he or she chooses with his or her own person and property, so long as he or she does not interfere, by force or fraud (or the threat thereof), with the equal right of others to do as they choose with their own persons and property. 

    2.2.4 No law shall abridge the right of persons to the peaceful control of their own bodies, nor interfere with voluntary, consensual, or contractual relations among persons, or the right to form cooperative ventures of any kind; nor invade the privacy of peaceful persons, nor by confiscation, expropriation, regulation, redistribution, restriction, control, or any other means abridge the right of any person to acquire property by homestead, purchase, or gift, or to use, control, exchange, lease, sell, transfer, bequeath, dispose of, or in any manner enjoy, their property without interference, until and unless the exercise of their control infringes the freedom of others; nor shall private property be fully or partially taken for public use without the consent of, and mutually agreeable compensation to, the owner. 
    2.2.5 No law shall create a class of victimless or consensual crimes. 

    2.2.6 No law shall abridge the right of freedom of association; any person may associate or transact with any other person or refuse to associate or transact with any other person for any reason, and the proprietor or lawful possessor of any movable or immovable property may exclude or refuse admission to any other person, except where such property is being used to violate the rights of others. 

    2.2.7 No law shall abridge the freedom of thought and feeling, or their peaceful expression or dissemination, as in speech, press and other media, artistic depiction, or religious practice; nor shall any law be made to promote or hinder religion, artistic culture, scientific research, or communication; nor shall the Government operate or support any school, college, or university. 

    2.2.8 No law shall abridge the right of the people peaceably to assemble, or to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 

    2.2.9 No law shall countenance the existence of slavery, conscription, indenture, or any other form of involuntary servitude within Liberland, or in any place subject to its jurisdiction. 

    2.2.10 No law shall restrict or hamper the free and peaceful movement of persons, goods, or ideas within or across the borders of Liberland. 

    2.2.11 No law shall abridge the right of any person to use or issue any commodity or item as currency; nor 
    shall the Government of Liberland engage in monetary regulation or issue of any sort.

    2.2.12 No law shall abridge the right of self-defense by victims or their agents against initiators of aggression (including governments or their agents), including the right, to own, manufacture, sell, and bear arms; 

    however, the right to own, manufacture, sell, and bear arms shall not extend to weapons of mass destruction   defined as nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons and any other similar weapon whose devastation cannot be confined to a specific threat and whose possession in a populated area constitutes an aggravated assault on the population. . Additionally, the right of self-defense shall not be construed to license resistance on the part of such aggressors to the legitimate use of force against them in defense of the rights of their victims. 

    2.2.13 No law shall establish occupational licensure, nor make or claim grants of monopoly privilege, nor restrict competition or free entry into any profession or industry, including the services of adjudication, protection, and enforcement of legitimate rights. 

    2.2.14 No person shall be convicted for violating government secrecy classifications unless the government discharges its burden of proving that the publication violated the right of privacy of those who have been coerced into revealing confidential information to government agents, or disclosed defensive military plans so as to materially impair the capability to respond to attack; but it shall be a valid defense to such prosecution that information divulged shows that the government has violated the law. 
    2.2.15 Any owner or owners of land may secede with their property from the jurisdiction of the Free Republic of Liberland, whereupon their territory shall become a sovereign independent state in accordance with international law. 

    2.2.16 The enumeration in this Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. 

    2.2.17 The existence of a state of emergency shall not be construed to limit the individual rights, or to expand the governmental powers, herein enumerated. 

    2.2.18 The powers not delegated to the Government by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the Cantons, are reserved to the Cantons respectively, or to the people.
